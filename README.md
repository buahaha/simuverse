# Simuverse
This is a simulation of every stage of life of simple particles in multiverse environemt. Includes simple example of usage. Simuverse thinks of particles as parents to another particles and creates them using random numbers giving them handles to connect to another particles in universe and layers this out to another multiverses. There can be random number of handles attached to given particle type (assumes current physics number of basic particles) and one is needed for particle "parent" particle.

Example program assumes one universe in multiverse and passes only limited number of periods when the particle is created.

This program could work better when ported to C or C++, but it would need some tweaking on to do so, as it uses generics to work with particles.
